# Real-time Flight Analytics with Flink + Pinot

## Use Case: Flight Traffic Analytics Dashboard

### Architecture
```
Kafka (Flight Data) → Flink (Stream Processing) → Pinot (OLAP) → Dashboard
```

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Real-time Aggregations**
   - Flights per country (last 5 minutes)
   - Average altitude by region
   - Speed distribution analysis
   - Ground vs Air ratio trends

2. **Time-series Analytics**
   - Flight density heat maps
   - Peak traffic hours
   - Route popularity trends
   - Airline performance metrics

### Flink Processing Jobs
```sql
-- Flight density by region (5-minute windows)
SELECT 
  origin_country,
  COUNT(*) as flight_count,
  AVG(velocity * 3.6) as avg_speed_kmh,
  AVG(geo_altitude) as avg_altitude,
  TUMBLE_START(processing_time, INTERVAL '5' MINUTE) as window_start
FROM flight_stream
GROUP BY origin_country, TUMBLE(processing_time, INTERVAL '5' MINUTE)
```

### Pinot Schema
```json
{
  "tableName": "flight_analytics",
  "dimensions": ["origin_country", "on_ground", "time_bucket"],
  "metrics": ["flight_count", "avg_speed", "avg_altitude", "max_altitude"],
  "timeColumn": "timestamp"
}
```

### Dashboard Queries
```sql
-- Top 10 busiest countries (last hour)
SELECT origin_country, SUM(flight_count) as total_flights
FROM flight_analytics 
WHERE timestamp > now() - 3600000
GROUP BY origin_country 
ORDER BY total_flights DESC 
LIMIT 10

-- Speed trends by hour
SELECT 
  DATETIMECONVERT(timestamp, '1:HOURS') as hour,
  AVG(avg_speed) as hourly_avg_speed
FROM flight_analytics
WHERE timestamp > now() - 86400000
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour
```

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Flink job for basic aggregations
2. **Phase 2**: Pinot setup with real-time ingestion
3. **Phase 3**: Analytics dashboard with charts
4. **Phase 4**: Alerting on anomalies (traffic spikes, etc.)

### Benefits
- **Sub-second queries** on large datasets
- **Real-time insights** for air traffic control
- **Historical analysis** for capacity planning
- **Anomaly detection** for safety monitoring
