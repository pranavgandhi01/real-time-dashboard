## Version History

### Version Numbering
- **Major**: Breaking changes or significant architectural updates
- **Minor**: New features, services, or major enhancements
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, security updates, or minor improvements

### Release Process
1. Update version numbers in configurations
2. Update this changelog with release notes
3. Tag release in version control
4. Deploy to staging environment for testing
5. Deploy to production environment
6. Monitor deployment and rollback if necessary

### Upgrade Notes

#### From 0.x to 1.0.0
- Complete infrastructure redesign
- New service dependencies (Kubernetes for Kafka)
- Updated port allocations
- New management scripts and procedures
- Enhanced security configurations

### Breaking Changes

#### Version 1.0.0
- **Port Changes**: Grafana moved from 3001 to 3000
- **Kafka Access**: External access now via NodePort 32092
- **Network Architecture**: Services now use isolated Docker networks
- **Management**: New script-based management system

### Migration Guide

#### Upgrading to 1.0.0
1. **Backup Data**: Export existing Grafana dashboards and Prometheus data
2. **Stop Services**: Use old shutdown procedures
3. **Update Configuration**: Pull latest configurations
4. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Docker Compose v2, Kind, kubectl
5. **Deploy New Stack**: Use new startup scripts
6. **Restore Data**: Import dashboards and configure data sources
7. **Verify Services**: Run health checks and validate functionality

### Known Issues

#### Version 1.0.0
- **Grafana/Frontend Port Conflict**: Both services default to port 3000
  - **Workaround**: Run services separately or modify port configuration
- **Kafka Startup Time**: Initial cluster deployment can take 5-10 minutes
  - **Expected**: Normal behavior for Kubernetes-based Kafka deployment
- **Kind Cluster Resources**: Requires 4GB+ RAM for stable operation
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure adequate system resources before deployment

### Deprecation Notices

#### Deprecated in 1.0.0
- Direct Docker Kafka deployment (replaced with Kubernetes/Strimzi)
- Manual service management (replaced with automated scripts)
- Insecure default configurations (replaced with hardened settings)

#### Removal Timeline
- **Version 1.1.0**: Remove legacy Docker Kafka configurations
- **Version 1.2.0**: Remove manual management procedures
- **Version 2.0.0**: Require authentication for all services

### Security Updates

#### Version 1.0.0
- Implemented network isolation between service tiers
- Added resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Configured non-root container execution where possible
- Enhanced secrets management practices
- Added security monitoring and alerting capabilities

### Performance Improvements

#### Version 1.0.0
- Optimized container resource allocation
- Implemented efficient log collection and rotation
- Added performance monitoring and alerting
- Configured persistent storage for better I/O performance
- Optimized network communication between services
